# VOG & Air Quality Dashboard Frontend

This is the frontend for the VOG & Air Quality Dashboard, built with React and deployed on Render.

## ðŸš€ Deployment on Render

This frontend is configured to be deployed on Render as a Static Site. The backend is deployed separately and connected via environment variables.

### Prerequisites

- Your backend deployed on Render (get the URL from your Render dashboard)
- Firebase project (if using Firebase for sensor data)

### Environment Variables

Configure these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

```env
REACT_APP_PREDICTION_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.onrender.com
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api

# Firebase Configuration (if using Firebase)
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://your_project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Deploy to Render

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Create a new Static Site
3. Use the following settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `build`
4. Add the environment variables listed above
5. Deploy!

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
