✅ **Firebase Hosting Disabled**: The hosting service for project `air-quality-monitoring-f97b2` has been disabled
✅ **Firebase Configuration Files Removed**:

## Firebase Services Still Active

The following Firebase services are still available and configured:
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: For sensor data storage

## Environment Variables

Your `render.yaml` still contains the necessary Firebase environment variables for:
