# CORS Error Fix Guide

## Problem
Your frontend at `https://thesis-website-deployment.onrender.com` is getting blocked by CORS policy when trying to access your backend at `https://thesis-backend-zrcb.onrender.com`. The error message indicates that the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing from the backend response.

## Root Cause
The backend server is not configured to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend domain. This is a security feature that prevents websites from making requests to other domains without explicit permission.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Backend CORS Configuration (Recommended)

You need to modify your backend code to include the proper CORS headers. Add these headers to all responses in your backend:

```javascript
// For Express.js backend
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://thesis-website-deployment.onrender.com');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  
  // Handle preflight requests
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

Or if using a CORS middleware:

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://thesis-website-deployment.onrender.com',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```

### Solution 2: Allow All Origins (Development Only)

If you want to allow all origins (not recommended for production):

```javascript
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
```

### Solution 3: Use a CORS Proxy (Temporary Workaround)

If you can't modify the backend immediately, you can use a CORS proxy service. I've created a test file at `public/cors-proxy.html` that demonstrates this approach.

### Solution 4: Deploy Backend with Proper CORS

Make sure your backend deployment includes the CORS configuration. Check your backend deployment logs to ensure the CORS headers are being set correctly.

## Testing the Fix

1. After implementing the backend fix, test the connection using the browser's developer tools
2. Check the Network tab to see if the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present in the response
3. The error should disappear and your predictions should load properly

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend code updated to handle CORS errors gracefully
- ✅ Added explicit CORS mode to fetch requests
- ✅ Added better error logging for CORS issues
- ❌ Backend CORS configuration needs to be fixed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the backend CORS configuration (Solution 1)
2. **Test**: Verify the fix works by checking the browser console
3. **Deploy**: Redeploy your backend with the CORS fix
4. **Verify**: Test your frontend to ensure predictions load correctly

## Additional Notes

- The CORS error is a browser security feature, not a bug in your code
- The fix must be implemented on the backend server
- Once fixed, your frontend will work correctly without any additional changes
